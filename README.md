# Alien_vs_Predator_RESNET_Model_Training

Overview

This project uses a customizable ResNet architecture to classify images as either "Alien" or "Predator." The dataset, obtained from Kaggle, contains labeled training and test images for binary classification.

Dataset

•	Source: Alien vs Predator Images on Kaggle
•	Structure: 
o	train/: Contains labeled training images.
o	validation/: Contains labeled validation images.
o	test/: Contains labeled test images.
Data Preprocessing
•	Images are resized to (224, 224) to match the input size for the ResNet model.
•	Pixel values are normalized to the range [0, 1].

Model Architecture

The model is a customizable ResNet built using TensorFlow/Keras. Key components:
1.	Residual Blocks: 
o	Two convolutional layers with batch normalization and ReLU activation.
o	Shortcut connections for improved gradient flow.
2.	Network Structure: 
o	Initial convolution and max pooling.
o	Four stages of residual blocks with increasing filter sizes.
o	Global Average Pooling and a Dense output layer with softmax activation.

Future Work

•	Improve model generalization using data augmentation.
•	Explore transfer learning with pre-trained ResNet models (e.g., ResNet50).
•	Deploy the model via Flask or FastAPI for real-time predictions.
•	Convert the model to TensorFlow Lite for mobile deployment.
